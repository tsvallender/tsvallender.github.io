## Energy

Energy provides the ability to do *work*. When work is done on a
system, energy is added to it.

<div class="important-note">$$\text{work done} = \text{force} \times \text{distance}$$

$$W = Fd$$</div>

Force is measured in newtons (which it is important to note are a
vector quantity) and distance in metres. This means work done will be
measured in newtons per metre (N m). We can now introduce joules,
which are an equivalent unit to 1 N m.

<div class="important-note">1 J = 1 N m = 1 kg m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup></div>

### Types of energy

There are many types of energy but these can all be classified as
types of one of the three fundamental types:

<dl>
  <dt>Kinetic energy</dt>
  <dd>associated with motion.</dd>
  <dt>Potential energy</dt>
  <dd>"stored" energy --- for example when a body is in a force field.</dd>
  <dt>Radiation energy</dt>
  <dd>carried by electromagnetic waves.</dd>
</dl>

These classifications are not always well-defined --- they often overlap.

A change in gravitational potential energy is given by:

<div class="important-note">$$\Delta E _{p} = mgh$$</div>

Where _m_ is mass, _g_ is the gravitational constant and _h_ is the distance.

Kinetic energy is given by:

<div class="important-note">$$E _{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv ^{2}$$</div>

## Power

Power is the speed of the generation or transfer of energy.

<div class="important-note">$$\text{power} = \frac{\text{energy}}{\text{time}}$$

$$P = \frac{E}{t}$$</div>

Note that energy in the above equation is interchangeable with _work_.

Power is measured in watts. One watt is equivalent to one joule per
second.

## Conservation of energy

The principle of conservation of energy is key. It is also the first
law of thermodynamics. It states:

<div class="important-note">Energy can be changed from one form to
another but never created or destroyed.</div>

## Efficiency

Efficiency is the ratio of useful output from a given input. It is
generally given as a percentage.

<div class="important-note">$$\text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful output}}{\text{input}}$$</div>
