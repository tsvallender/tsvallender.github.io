## Standards

A standard is the result of accumulated experience; success and
failure. They dictate critical features of a design, construction
methods or use and safety testing of products. They can also apply to
things such as safe working practices on construction sites (e.g. the
Construction Skills Certification Scheme --- CSCS --- in the UK).

Standards:
* summarise good practice, ensuring safety and that a product is fit
  for purpose.
* can protect engineers from legal challenge by proving work conforms
  to the relevant standard.
* protect clients from poor engineering.

It is important standards not inhibit innovation and slow progress,
and so it is the responsibility of a standard's administrating
authority to keep it relevant and up to date.

Some standards are legally enforced, others are _codes of practice_
which are guidelines.

Standards authorities include:
* British Standards Institution (BSI)
* American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
* Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN)
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

Increasingly national standards are being subsumed by international
ones due to the pressures of globalisation.

The UK-SPEC is the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence.

## Patents

A patent ensures no-one else can make, use, sell or import an invention without the patent-holder's permission. They last for up to twenty years.
