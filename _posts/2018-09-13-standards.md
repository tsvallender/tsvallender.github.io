## Standards

A standard is the result of accumulated experience; success and
failure. They dictate critical features of a design, construction
methods or use and safety testing of products. They can also apply to
things such as safe working practices on construction sites (e.g. the
Construction Skills Certification Scheme --- CSCS --- in the UK).

Standards:
* summarise good practice, ensuring safety and that a product is fit
  for purpose.
* can protect engineers from legal challenge by proving work conforms
  to the relevant standard.
* protect clients from poor engineering.

It is important standards not inhibit innovation and slow progress,
and so it is the responsibility of a standard's administrating
authority to keep it relevant and up to date.

Some standards are legally enforced, others are _codes of practice_
which are guidelines.

Standards authorities include:
* British Standards Institution (BSI)
* American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
* Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN)
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

Increasingly national standards are being subsumed by international
ones due to the pressures of globalisation.

The UK-SPEC is the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence.

## Patents

A patent ensures no-one else can make, use, sell or import an
invention without the patent-holder's permission. They last for up to
twenty years. If another organisation wishes to manufacture the
product they generally pay royalties to the patent holder.

If the patent is infringed, the holder can institute legal
proceedings. It is their responsibility to ensure the patent is not
infringed and enforcing it can be very costly. A patent offers little
protection within a country in which it is not recognised.

Legally, an invention must be:
* Novel;
* Original (or not obvious to a skilled practitioner);
* Capable of being manufactured, programmed or specified (depending on
  the type of invention).

## Alternatives to patents

* _Registered design:_ protects a products outward design and appearance,
  but not its function.
* _Copyright:_ unregistered and automatic, copyright can protect written
  works, music, software, architectural and design drawings and even
  specific design details. Lasts seventy years after the death of the
  copyright holder.
* _Design right:_ replaced copyright in 1988 for industrial designs.
  Automatic cover as long as originality can be proven. Cannot cover methods
  of construction. Lasts ten years from the selling of a new product. Parts
  which "must mate" with another are excluded to promote interoperability.
* _Trademarks:_ registered names or symbols.
