## Manufacturing methods

* Casting
* Forming
* Machining
* Joining

## Classifying product shapes

**Continuous** shapes are those with a profile which does not change
along its length. They are often referred to as "2D", as only two
dimensions are significant in the manufacturing
process. Mathematically, they are prisms.

**Sheet products** have an almost constant section thickness which is
small in comparison with their other dimensions. 3D sheet products are
formed from flat sheets. A bucket or much plastic furniture, for
example.

**Bulk** shapes have complex forms, often with little symmetry. They
may be solid or hollow.

## Cost of manufacturing

**Direct costs** are those such as materials and labour. They can be
_directly attributed to the production of the product_. **Indirect
costs cannot be closely linked in this way. They are often termed
"overheads" and include power, rent, machinery, insurance,
non-production salaries etc.

**Material cost** is the volume of _raw material_ (m) required per
product multiplied by the cost of material per unit mass (C).

$$M = mC$$

**Material utilisation** shows us how much of the initial raw material
is used in the final product.

<div class="important-note">
$$mu = \frac{\text{mass of product}}{\text{mass of raw material per product}}$$
</div>

## Casting

Casting is the process of filling a mould with a fluid which then
solidifies in the shape of the mould cavity. This transition can occur
in three ways:

* The material can be heated until it melts; solidification will
  generally occur as the material cools but a chemical reaction can
  also be used.
* The material can be dissolved in a solvent; solidification will occur
  when the solvent is evaporated.
* A reaction can be caused in a liquid causing the formation of a different
  solid material.

The method chosen will depend heavily on the material being used and
may be a factor in choice of material. For example thermoplastic
polymers can be repeatedly softened by heating whereas a thermosetting
polymer decompose instead of melting at higher temperatures. Some
materials may react with oxygen and become weaker, meaning they must
be cast in inert atmospheres.

### Methods of casting

**Permanent pattern with non-permanent mould** is a process in which a
"pattern" is used to form an impression which becomes the mould
cavity. The mould is then destroyed to remove the product, but the
pattern can be reused. It is often appropriate for small-quantity
production or one-offs. One example of this method is sand casting.

**Pattern-free permanent mould**

A die (or mould) is used repeatedly and opened to release the cast
product.

**Expendable mould and pattern**

A pattern is made from a material with a low melting temperature, the
mould is built around it. The pattern is then melted away and the
product cast. The mould is destroyed to retrieve the casting.
