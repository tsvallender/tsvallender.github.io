## Manufacturing methods

* Casting
* Forming
* Machining
* Joining

## Classifying product shapes

**Continuous** shapes are those with a profile which does not change
along its length. They are often referred to as "2D", as only two
dimensions are significant in the manufacturing
process. Mathematically, they are prisms.

**Sheet products** have an almost constant section thickness which is
small in comparison with their other dimensions. 3D sheet products are
formed from flat sheets. A bucket or much plastic furniture, for
example.

**Bulk** shapes have complex forms, often with little symmetry. They
may be solid or hollow.

## Cost of manufacturing

**Direct costs** are those such as materials and labour. They can be
_directly attributed to the production of the product_. **Indirect
costs cannot be closely linked in this way. They are often termed
"overheads" and include power, rent, machinery, insurance,
non-production salaries etc.

**Material cost** is the volume of _raw material_ (m) required per
product multiplied by the cost of material per unit mass (C).

$$M = mC$$

**Material utilisation** shows us how much of the initial raw material
is used in the final product.

<div class="important-note">
$$mu = \frac{\text{mass of product}}{\text{mass of raw material per product}}$$
</div>

## Casting

Casting is the process of filling a mould with a fluid which then
solidifies in the shape of the mould cavity. This transition can occur
in three ways:

* The material can be heated until it melts; solidification will
  generally occur as the material cools but a chemical reaction can
  also be used.
* The material can be dissolved in a solvent; solidification will occur
  when the solvent is evaporated.
* A reaction can be caused in a liquid causing the formation of a different
  solid material.

The method chosen will depend heavily on the material being used and
may be a factor in choice of material. For example thermoplastic
polymers can be repeatedly softened by heating whereas a thermosetting
polymer decompose instead of melting at higher temperatures. Some
materials may react with oxygen and become weaker, meaning they must
be cast in inert atmospheres.

### Methods of casting

**Permanent pattern with non-permanent mould** is a process in which a
"pattern" is used to form an impression which becomes the mould
cavity. The mould is then destroyed to remove the product, but the
pattern can be reused. It is often appropriate for small-quantity
production or one-offs.

One example of this method is sand casting. Runners and risers are
used to allow the liquid to be poured in and fill with excess
fluid. Cores can be inserted to produce hollow castings. Downsides of
sand casting are the rough finish and poor suitability to small items
or details. Surface finishing is generally required and the runners
and risers must be removed.

**Pattern-free permanent mould**

A die (or mould) is used repeatedly and opened to release the cast
product.

Gravity die-casting uses a solid metal mould into which the liquid is
poured. Pressure die-casting is similar but the molten metal is
injected under pressure. This makes the process faster but increases
the likelihood of defects. It also allows smaller thicknesses which
relying on gravity alone does not.

Injection moulding is the most common process when working with
thermoplastic polymer materials. Most polymers begin to degrade before
they reach high enough temperatures to fill a mould solely under the
influence of gravity and so a screw is used to push along granules
which are melted before entering the mould. At the final stage, the
screw acts as a ram, moving axially. The high pressures straighten the
polymer's molecules, reducing its viscosity. This is known as shear
thinning.

**Expendable mould and pattern**

A pattern is made from a material with a low melting temperature, the
mould is built around it. The pattern is then melted away and the
product cast. The mould is destroyed to retrieve the casting.

One method here is investment casting, used for casting metals with a
high melting point, such as jet engine parts. A wax pattern is used,
dipped into ceramic slurry, which is built up with ceramic
particles. This is the investment process. The wax is then melted out,
giving the alternate name "lost wax process". Molten metal is then
poured into the mould, before breaking away the ceramic mould.

## Microstructure and defects

When metals cool during the casting process, grains form and dendrites
grow --- tree-like structures. These can lead to the formation of
voids, measured by the material's porosity. Often inclusions are also
found.

Many undesirable inclusions can be removed by heating the material to
below its melting point --- "dissolving" the impurities. Voids are
hard to avoid and can have catastrophic implications, but can be
reduced via the use of runners and risers with their associated
reservoirs.

When casting ingots, the process is generally not tightly controlled
as the properties of the final product are determined during later
forming stages.
