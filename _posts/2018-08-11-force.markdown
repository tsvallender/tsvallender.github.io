Isaac Newton's three laws of motion set in place some of the most
important aspects of modern physics, and the wider sciences. Here,
they present us our window to examine the wider topic of force,
motion, and movement in general.

Motion
------

Let's get started by looking at speed, and how we define it. Speed can
be defined as the amount of distance moved in a given timeframe, and
so it follows we can calculate it by dividing distance by time. The SI
units for distance and time are metres and seconds, giving us a unit
for speed of metres per second (or m s<sup>-1</sup>).

$$\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$$

Note that distance is a _scalar_ quantity --- it measures only
magnitude, not direction. If we add direction, it becomes a _vector_
quantity, namely *displacement*. If we replace distance with
displacement in the above equation, we have the equation for velocity
--- the vector of speed plus distance.

$$\text{velocity} = \frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time}}$$

Now, it would also be useful to be able to calculate rate of change in
velocity, i.e. acceleration. Now, you might think of acceleration as
increase in speed, but in engineering terms that's not precisely
it. Acceleration measures change in velocity, which has two
consequences which may not be immediately obvious:

* An object slowing down has a measurable acceleration --- simply a
  negative one.
* A change in direction but not speed is also a measurable acceleration.
  As a consequence of measuring a change in a vector quantity,
  acceleration is itself a vector quantity.

So how do we measure acceleration? We divide the change in velocity by
the time that change takes. Assuming we're measuring velocity in m
s<sup>-1</sup> and thus time in seconds, that gives us a unit of
metres per second per second, or m s<sup>-2</sup>.

Mass
----

So now we can measure the way things move. We also need to measure how
much of a thing there is, that is, its mass. Mass tells us how much
matter there is in an object, and the SI unit for mass is the
kilogram. _Kilograms do not measure weight, they measure mass._ Weight
is a measure of the gravitational force acting on an object. It is
different on different planets and, to a lesser extent, even in
different places on Earth.

Newton's first law of motion
----------------------------

> An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight
  line unless acted on by an external force.

So, if an object is stationary it will remain stationary unless a
force puts it into motion. This seems like common sense. So does the
fact that an object in motion will not change direction unless a force
causes this to happen.

What may seem less obvious is that an object which is in motion _will
not stop or slow down_ unless a force causes it to do so. We are not
used to objects moving on endlessly without slowing because our
intuition has developed on Earth, where a number of forces cause
objects to slow and stop. Most commonly, friction and air resistance.

### Friction

Friction is the force between two surfaces which are moving (or
attempting to move) relative to each other. Friction will always act
to slow down or stop an object.

### So many forces

Most objects on Earth will have many forces operating on them at any
one time. These will include gravity and air pressure. In order to
determine whether and how the object will move, the total force acting
on the object must be determined. This is called the *resultant* or
*net force*. This will take into account the magnitude and direction
of each force and combine them.

Newton's second law of motion
-----------------------------

> $$\text{force} = \text{mass} \times \text{acceleration}$$

> $$F = ma$$

So Newton's second law tells us we can find out the force acting on an
object by multiplying its mass by its acceleration. For example, if I
have a mass of 80 kg and am accelerating at 2 m s<sup>-2</sup> there
is a force of 160 kg m s<sup>-2</sup>. Now because "kg m
s<sup>-2</sup>" is both common and unwieldy, we have the equivalent
unit of newtons. That is, 1 N = 1 kg m<sup>-2</sup>.

Newton's third law of motion
----------------------------

> If an object A exerts a force on an object B, object B will exert a
  force on object B which is equal in magnitude but opposite in
  direction.

Often expressed as "for every action there is an equal and opposite
reaction", this law defines the *reaction force*. It tells us that,
for example, if you try to push a brick wall with a force of 1 N, it
also pushes back with a force of 1 N. Similarly, objects being pulled
by Earth's gravity also pull on the Earth with an equal force to that
being exerted on them.
