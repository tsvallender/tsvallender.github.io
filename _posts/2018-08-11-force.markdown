Isaac Newton's three laws of motion set in place some of the most
important aspects of modern physics, and the wider sciences. Here,
they present us our window to examine the wider topic of force,
motion, and movement in general.

Motion
------

Let's get started by looking at speed, and how we define it. Speed can
be defined as the amount of distance moved in a given timeframe, and
so it follows we can calculate it by dividing distance by time. The SI
units for distance and time are metres and seconds, giving us a unit
for speed of metres per second (or m s<sup>-1</sup>).

$$\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$$

Newton's first law of motion
----------------------------

> An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight
  line unless acted on by an external force.

So, if an object is stationary it will remain stationary unless a
force puts it into motion. This seems like common sense. So does the
fact that an object in motion will not change direction unless a force
causes this to happen.

What may seem less obvious is that an object which is in motion _will
not stop or slow down_ unless a force causes it to do so. We are not
used to objects moving on endlessly without slowing because our
intuition has developed on Earth, where a number of forces cause
objects to slow and stop. Most commonly, friction and air resistance.

### Friction

Friction is the force between two surfaces which are moving (or
attempting to move) relative to each other. Friction will always act
to slow down or stop an object.

### So many forces

Most objects on Earth will have many forces operating on them at any
one time. These will include gravity and air pressure. In order to
determine whether and how the object will move, the total force acting
on the object must be determined. This is called the *resultant* or
*net force*. This will take into account the magnitude and direction
of each force and combine them.
