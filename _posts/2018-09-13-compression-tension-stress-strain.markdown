# Compression and tension

Forces can be classed one of two ways --- *compressive* or
*tensile*. To put it another way, a force can either put an object
under compression or tension. Compression can be thought of as a
"squeezing" force, whereas tension might be thought of as a "pulling
apart" force. Different materials or arrangements of materials are
able to withstand different amounts of one or other types of force,
and so the types of force expected to be encountered should influence
the choice of material and the configuration that material is used in.

The two forces are not mutually exclusive. For example, imagine a gap
bridged by a sheet of material (which material is not currently
important). You walk across this makeshift bridge and as you do so it
bends (to use the technical term, it is _displaced_ under
load). Different parts of the bridge are under different types of
load. As it bends downward, the top half of the sheet is under
compressive force, being pushed together, while the bottom half is
under tension, being pulled apart (see Figure 1).

Ceramic materials such as stone are very strong under compressive
forces, but less strong under tensile forces. We can arrange our
materials in such a way that accounts for their strengths and
weaknesses. One technique in traditional bridge building is to use a
design which maximises the amount of material under compression and
thus also minimises the amount under tension. This can be seen at the
Pont du Gard (Figure 2).

# Strain

Strain is defined as the ratio of the change in length --- i.e. the
extension --- to the original length. It is generally represented by
the lowercase Greek letter epsilon (Îµ), and often given as a
percentage.

<div class="important-note">$$\text{strain} = \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}}
     			    = \epsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l _1}$$</div>
