## Projectiles

A projectile is an object moving through the air as a result of being
thrown, hit or dropped. The science of studying the motion of
projectiles is ballistics.

Horizontal and vertical motion are independent of one another and can
thus be calculated independently.

We can use the standard equations for displacement to calculate the
projectiles motion. If the projectile is fired horizontally,
horizontal displacement will be given by $$s_h = v_h t$$. Vertical
displacement will be given by $$s_v = u_v t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

If the projectile is fired at an angle we must take components to find
its initial velocity in each direction:

<div class="important-note">
$$u_h = u \cos \theta$$

$$u_v = u \sin \theta$$

Where _u_ is the initial velocity.
