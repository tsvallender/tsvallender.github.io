## Fuel

Nuclear fuels which are in current use are based on either naturally
occurring uranium, or on uranium which has been "enriched". This means
it has been processed to increase the proportion of isotopes which
will undergo nuclear fission.

## Fission and fusion

**Fission** is the process in which an unstable nucleus divides into
two smaller nuclei. This releases subatomic particles and large
amounts of energy.

**Fusion** is the process in which two elements collide with
sufficient energy for their nuclei to combine, creating a heavier
element. This also releases large amounts of energy.
