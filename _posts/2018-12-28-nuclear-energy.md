## Radioactivity

All isotopes of elements heavier than lead have unstable nuclei; they
are radioactive and spontaneously emit high-energy atomic particles in
a process termed radioactive decay. As a result, they may become
nuclei of different elements or isotopes.

There are three types of particle which can be emitted during
radioactive decay:

<dl>
<dt>α-particles</dt>
<dd>Consist of two protons and two neutrons, have relatively low energy
and can be stopped by, for example, a sheet of paper, a few centimetres
of air or human skin. If inhaled or ingested they can cause serious
health issues.</dd>
<dt>β-particles</dt>
<dd>Consist of electrons released when a neutron decays to form a proton
and electron. Can be stopped by a few mm of metal. Can cause burns to skin
but ingestion or inhalation is necessary for serious damage.</dd>
<dt>γ-particles</dt>
<dd>Has a short wavelength and can be treated as either waves or particles.
Emitted when a nucleus releases surplus energy (often during one of the
other forms of radioactive decay) without changing the nucleus's number
of protons or neutrons. Stopped only by several centimetres of lead or steel
or a few feet of concrete. These are, along with neutrons, the chief
radiation hazard of nuclear technology.</dd>

## Fuel

Nuclear fuels which are in current use are based on either naturally
occurring uranium, or on uranium which has been "enriched". This means
it has been processed to increase the proportion of isotopes which
will undergo nuclear fission.

## Fission and fusion

**Fission** is the process in which an unstable nucleus divides into
two smaller nuclei. This releases subatomic particles and large
amounts of energy. It is used in conventional nuclear reactors and
atomic bombs.

**Fusion** is the process in which two elements collide with
sufficient energy for their nuclei to combine, creating a heavier
element. This also releases large amounts of energy. It occurs in
stars and in hydrogen bombs.

## Generating power

Fissile elements have nuclei which split into smaller nuclei when the
nucleus is hit by and absorbs a subatomic particle such as a neutron.

There are two main isotopes of natural uranium, <sup>235</sup>U and
<sup>238</sup>U. As the latter requires much higher-impact neutrons
for fission to occur, the former is preferred. "Enriched" uranium is
that with a higher percentage of <sup>235</sup>U.

When the nucleus of a <sup>235</sup>U atom is hit by and absorbs a
neutron (the probability of which is dependent upon the neutron's
energy), the resulting neutron is unstable and divides into krypton
and barium, and releases a large amount of energy along with
β-particles, γ-radiation and three further neutrons. The new neutrons
could be absorbed by other atoms which do not undergo fission, leave
the mass of uranium or hit another atom of <sup>235</sup>U, repeating
the process. If this final option occurs in sufficient number a
**chain reaction** takes place.

Chain reactions are necessary for the production of nuclear power but
an uncontrolled chain reaction can result in an explosion --- this is
the basis of a nuclear bomb. However, the chain reaction can be
controlled by using less than a **critical mass** of <sup>235</sup>U
and by **control rods** --- formed of neutron-absorbing materials such
as boron.

In a typical pressurised water reactor (PWR), water is used as a
coolant and transfers heat to a secondary coolant by means of a steam
generator or heat exchanger, driving a turbine as in a conventional
power station. The coolant water also acts as a _moderator_, slowing
neutrons to increase the likelihood of neutron release during fission.

## Problems with nuclear power

### Perception

Nuclear power is seen as unsafe, partly due to high-profile accidents
and its links with nuclear weapons.

### Cost

Nuclear power has high capital costs and often exceeds budgets. State
support is often required which can be controversial.

### Waste management

Nuclear power stations generate relatively small amounts of waste but
it can be much more problematic and require careful storage for years
or even centuries.
