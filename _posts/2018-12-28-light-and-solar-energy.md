## Light and other waves

There are two basic types of wave: **transverse waves**, such as all
electromagnetic waves and those in fluids; and **longitudinal waves**,
such as sound waves. In the former, vibrations of the waves are at
right angles with the movement of the wave itself; in the latter they
are in the same direction.

All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, which is
2.998×10<sup>8</sup> m s<sup>-1</sup> in a vacuum.

Light can be thought of as made up of discrete bundles of energy
called **photons** that travel as electromagnetic waves.

### Properties of a wave

**Wavelength** (λ) is the distance between two consecutive peak
values, measured in metres.

**Period** (_T_) is the time interval between two consecutive peak
values, measured in seconds.

**Frequency** (_f_) is the reciprocal of the period, the number of
cycles per second, measured in Hz.

**Amplitude** (_A_) is the maximum value of the varying quality, where
units will depend upon the wave's nature.

<div class="important-note">
$$\text{wavelength} \times \text{frequency} = \text{speed}$$

For electromagnetic radiation this is written $$c = \lambda f$$ where
_c_ is the speed of light.

The energy carried by a photon is proportional to its frequency and is given by

$$E = fh$$

where h is Planck's constant and equal to 6.626×10<sup>-34</sup> J
s. This equation provides a link between the wave or photon models of
describing light.  </div>

The colour of visible light depends upon its wavelength (or
frequency). Its intensity is determined by its amplitude and related
to the energy carried. The light's wavelength is dependent upon the
temperature of the source, with a high temperature, such as the sun,
leading to a low wavelength.

### Reflection

**Specular reflection** is how light reflects from a smooth surface,
such as a polished mirror or still water. This is when the majority of
rays are reflected at the _same angle_. **Diffuse reflection** is how
light reflects from a rougher surface, when rays are _scattered in
many directions_.

<div class="important-note">
The laws of reflection of light state:
<ol>
<li>The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</li>
<li>The angles of incidence and reflection and the normal to the surface
are all in the same plane.</li>
</ol>
</div>

## Generating power

Energy can be produced directly from sunlight by heating water in
"solar thermal" arrangements in which it heats the air in "Trombe
wall" cavities. This is an example of _passive_ solar
heating. _Active_ solar heating uses thermal energy to heat water
either directly or via a heat exchanger.

In order to generate electricity, photovoltaic (PV) panels are used. A
group wired together is known as a **solar array**.
