## Heat & temperature

Temperature is the measure of how hot or cold an object is. Heat
energy will always flow from a higher-temperature to a
lower-temperature object.

The SI unit for temperature is the *kelvin*. 0 L is equivalent to
_absolute zero_, i.e. no thermal energy. *Degrees Celsius* are more
commonly encountered than kelvin, however. A change of 1 °C is the
same as a change of 1 K, but 0 °C represents the freezing point of
water rather than absolute zero.

<div class="important-note">0 °C = 273.15 K</div>

## Specific heat capacity

In order to know how much thermal energy is required to raise an
object to a given temperature we must know its *specific heat
capacity*. The heat capacity of a substance tells us how much energy
is required to raise its temperature by a given amount (generally 1
K). The _specific_ heat capacity makes this more useful by scaling it
to be applicable to 1 kg of the substance (specific means "per unit
mass").

<div class="important-note">$$\Delta Q = mc \Delta T$$</div>

Here Δ_Q_ is heat energy required, _m_ is mass, _c_ is specific heat
capacity and ΔT is temperature difference.

## Heat transfer

Heat can be transferred in three ways:

<dl>
  <dt>Conduction</dt>
  <dd>The vibrations of atoms or molecules are transferred to other
  atoms or molecules by direct contact. Conduction is most important in
  solids. When it does occur in fluids it is termed *diffusion*. Some
  materials are better *conductors* than others. Poor conductors are called
  *insulators*.</dd>
  <dt>Convection</dt>
  <dd>The primary heat transfer mechanism in fluids, this is when hotter
  molecules move around more than cold ones, moving further apart. This means
  they are less dense and so begin to rise above the cooler, denser fluid
  which moves down.</dd>
  <dt>Radiation</dt>
  <dd>Heat being transferred by electromagnetic waves. This requires no
  substance to move through and can thus even travel through a vacuum.</dd>
</dl>

*Thermal management* is the use of heat transfer mechanisms to keep a
system within given temperature bounds.
