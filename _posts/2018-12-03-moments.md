## Forces at different angles

Where forces are working at a variety of angles it is generally
helpful to take components of these in order to work with them more
easily in the x and y-axis independently. As component vectors will
generally form a triangle with the original vector, trigonometric
functions may be used to work with them.

## Moments

A moment is the turning effect of a force. A moment is given by:

<div class="important-note">
$$\text{moment of force (N m)} = \text{force (N)} \times \text{perpendicular distance from force to reference point (m)}$$
</div>

It is worth reiterating that force is a vector quantity, so a moment
is also. Direction of a moment is described as clockwise or
anticlockwise.

The _principle of moments_ states that for a system to be in
equilibrium the sum of the clockwise moments must be equal to the sum
of the anticlockwise moments. This will be true regardless of what
points moments are taken about.
