Choice of the appropriate material is one of the most important parts
of engineering. Below I will look at some of the most common types of
materials and ways of classifying them.

# Metals and alloys

Metals have a huge range of properties, from hard steel and iron to
soft lead and liquid mercury. They generally don't break easily and
conduct heat and electricity well. As metals are generally highly
reactive they are rarely found in nature. This means they must be
extracted from ores (the rocks that contain them). This is done by
raising the ore to a very high temperature (the temperature required
will vary between ores).

When two or more metals are mixed together they form an _alloy_. This
can give rise to a wider range of properties which can be
exceptionally useful. Often only a very small amount of one metal is
needed to significantly change the properties of the overall alloy by
creating a new atomic structure.

# Ceramics

Ceramics are strong and hard, but brittle. They include clay, stone,
brick, cement, concrete and minerals. They are generally able to
withstand high temperatures and chemical attack.

Glass is an unusual ceramic with many interesting properties. For
instance, it has a relatively low melting point making it much easier
than other ceramics to process.

_Engineering ceramics_ are advanced ceramics developed for specialist
applications where specific properties are required.

# Plastics and polymers

Polymers can be both natural and synthetic. Plastic normally refers to
the subset of these derived from oil, which obviously leads to
sustainability issues. They vary wildly in their properties but are
united by their underlying chemical structure which is formed of long
chains of chemically joined sub-units. How these are arranged is key,
and some examples are given below.

_Thermoplastics_ are special polymers whichy become soft when heated
and solidify when cooled, making them useful for moulding.
