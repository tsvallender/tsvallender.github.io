Choice of the appropriate material is one of the most important parts
of engineering. Choice can generally be thought of as balancing the
four points:

* *Product:* how it will contribute to the overall product;
* *Property:* whether the material has appropriate qualities;
* *Process:* how the material will need to be manipulated;
* *Price:* how much it will cost.

# Defining properties

Engineering uses many words which are used generally in English to
have specific technical definitions. To avoid confusion and facilitate
communication it is important these are used correctly.

## Density

Note that density is given by dividing mass by volume, and is
generally represented as the lowercase Greek letter rho.

<div class="important-note">$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$</div>

Below I will look at some of the most common types of
materials and ways of classifying them.

# Metals and alloys

Metals have a huge range of properties, from hard steel and iron to
soft lead and liquid mercury. They generally don't break easily and
conduct heat and electricity well. As metals are generally highly
reactive they are rarely found in nature. This means they must be
extracted from ores (the rocks that contain them). This is done by
raising the ore to a very high temperature (the temperature required
will vary between ores).

When two or more metals are mixed together they form an _alloy_. This
can give rise to a wider range of properties which can be
exceptionally useful. Often only a very small amount of one metal is
needed to significantly change the properties of the overall alloy by
creating a new atomic structure.

One way of forming a metal into a desired object is _casting_. This is
when the metal is melted and poured into a mould. It is then cooled
until solid, when it will form the shape of the mould.

Iron can be processed in various ways. *Wrought iron* is the result of
prolonged hammering and repeated folding. This burns out the carbon in
the iron. Over time the processes used to create iron improved, such
as the development of blast furnaces. These increase temperatures by
blasting air through the hot mixture, allowing for continuous
production. Iron from this process could be used as *cast iron*. It
contains around 4% carbon. *Steel* was invented as further
improvements were made and the optimum amount of carbon was arrived at
--- around 2%.

Aluminium is a modern material as electricity is required in the
extraction process. A commercial process to achieve this was invented
in the twentieth century. High currents are required, making the
process expensive. Because of this, production tends to occur where
cheap power is readily available.

# Ceramics

Ceramics are strong and hard, but brittle. They include clay, stone,
brick, cement, concrete and minerals. They are generally able to
withstand high temperatures and chemical attack.

Glass is an unusual ceramic with many interesting properties. For
instance, it has a relatively low melting point making it much easier
than other ceramics to process.

_Engineering ceramics_ are advanced ceramics developed for specialist
applications where specific properties are required.

# Plastics and polymers

Polymers can be both natural and synthetic. Plastic normally refers to
the subset of these derived from oil, which obviously leads to
sustainability issues. They vary wildly in their properties but are
united by their underlying chemical structure which is formed of long
chains of chemically joined sub-units. These are generally carbon with
other atoms or groups of atoms hanging on the sides. How these are
arranged is key, and some examples are given below.

_Thermoplastics_ are special polymers whichy become soft when heated
and solidify when cooled, making them useful for moulding.

# Carbon-based materials

Carbon has three very different natural forms, coal which is weak and
brittle, graphite which is soft and useful as a lubricant or in
pencils and diamond, which is exceptionally hard. The vast differences
in these materials are caused by the way in which the carbon atoms are
arranged within the material.

Advancements in materials science have led to the development of other
carbon-based materials. *Carbon fibre composite* lines up short
strings of carbon atoms along the same axis as fibres, and blended
with other materials such as polymers to create an extremely strong
fabric.

*Graphene* is a form of carbon only one atom thick, which is
 exceptionally strong as well as being superconductive.
