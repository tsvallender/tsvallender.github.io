A **primary energy source** is one which occurs naturally; for example
coal, oil, solar and nuclear. A **secondary energy source** is
generated by a primary one; for example, electricity.

<div class="important-note">
The **efficiency** of any power generation process is given by:

$$\% \text{efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful electrical power generated}}{\text{energy supplied by the fuel}} \times 100\%$$

For a thermal power station (converting heat into power) maximum
efficiency is limited to $$1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}$$ where T<sub>h</sub>
is the temperature of hot steam entering the turbine and T<sub>c</sub>
is the temperature of the cold steam leaving. This means the hotter
the steam generated the higher the efficiency, and is known as the
**Carnot efficiency**. </div>

The **heat of combustion** is the amount of heat energy released per unit amount of fuel burned. Energy is measured in joules, the "unit amount" can be given in mol, kg or m<sup>3</sup>.

<div class="important-note">
$$\text{heat released (J)
	     = \text{heat of combustion (J kg^{-1})} \times \text{amount of fuel (kg)}
     	     = \text{heat of combustion (J m^{-3})} \times \text{amount of fuel (m^{3})}
     	     = \text{heat of combustion (J mol^{-1})} \times \text{amount of fuel(mol)}$$
</div>

Remember, this can then be used to calculate the power. 1 watt represents 1 joule per second.
