## D6 Magical team sports

| D | Sport | Description |
|--:|---:---|:------------|
| 1 | Freelkitball | Basketball, *but* the hoops are on enchanted poles, leaping about and determined not to be caught. It is the job of the *defracklers* to hold the pole still long enough for their teammates to shoot. |
| 2 | Towsnappa | Football, *but* the ball periodically changes in mass, varying from compressed planet to balloon. Players are expected to enchant their leg muscles with an appropriate degree of strength to maneuver the ball. |
| 3 | Aerostrom | Baseball, *but* played in the air atop broomsticks or other favoured mount. For every run scored, the weather worsens. |
| 4 | Frupworting | Tennis, *but* with teams of ten and twelve balls in play at all times. Every time a ball is hit, it grows larger and lighter, until it begins floating upward. |
| 5 | Dracostrith | Lacrosse, *but* the sticks are replaced with trained pygmy dragons. |
| 6 | Sphokkee | Hockey, *but* played on the inside surface of a sphere. There is one goal, floating in the centre of the sphere.
